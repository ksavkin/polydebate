6. Typography System

Ideal fonts to match modern fintech style:

Recommended (Google Fonts):
	•	Inter
	•	IBM Plex Sans
	•	Manrope
	•	Space Grotesk (for quant style headings)

Hierarchy example:
	•	H1: 28px Medium
	•	H2: 22px Medium
	•	Body: 15px Regular
	•	Caption: 13px Regular

6.1 Typography Principles: The 80/20 Rule

Most UIs are just text and buttons with some icons to help users take necessary actions. Mastering typography is that 20% of the design that gives you 80% of the results.

Key Principles:

Visual Hierarchy and Focus:
	•	Without proper typography, there's no hierarchy and point of focus
	•	Users can't tell what they're looking at - it's just a bunch of text
	•	Make titles bigger and bolder than the rest of the elements
	•	Use line height to create natural spacing (not just margin/padding)

Grouping and Separation:
	•	Use size, color, and spacing to group or separate elements
	•	Spacing falls under the law of proximity - use it to group related elements
	•	To emphasize one element, deemphasize others by adjusting lightness values
	•	White on black is already at max contrast - to emphasize, deemphasize surrounding elements

HSL Color Function for Typography:
	•	Always use HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) instead of hex or RGB
	•	Hue: The type of color (0-360 degrees, e.g., 0=red, 120=green, 240=blue)
	•	Saturation: Intensity of the color (0-100%, 0% = gray)
	•	Lightness: Brightness (0-100%, 50% = base color, 0% = black, 100% = white)
	•	For typography, focus primarily on the lightness (L) value
	•	Most important elements: highest contrast (100% lightness on dark, 0% on light)
	•	To deemphasize: reduce lightness (e.g., 60% lightness for secondary text)

Font Size Strategy:
	•	You only need 2-3 font sizes to design 99% of apps and UIs
	•	Pick a base font size: either 14px or 16px
	•	Use regular weight and 100% lightness for base text
	•	When you absolutely need variation, go 2 pixels up or down from base
	•	Combine size, weight, and color to create hierarchy - you don't need many sizes
	•	Example: Everything can be 14px except titles and headings

Line Height as Spacing:
	•	Line height automatically acts as margin-bottom for text elements
	•	In most cases, you don't need to manually add gap or margin
	•	Line height is crucial for titles to stand out and stand alone
	•	This creates natural spacing between text blocks

Global Typography Variables:
	•	Set font weight first
	•	Then font size and line height
	•	Finally font family
	•	Convert pixel units to rem for accessibility (users can adjust font size)
	•	Example structure:
	  - font-weight
	  - font-size (in rem)
	  - line-height (the crucial spacing value)
	  - font-family

Visual Hierarchy Rules:
	•	Code for document hierarchy, but style for visual hierarchy
	•	Not all H1 elements will share the same font style
	•	Use common sense to judge what the user will focus on and emphasize that text
	•	Font size is relative - it depends on neighboring elements
	•	Big bold fonts can be too harsh - sometimes reduce weight instead of increasing size
	•	Design for functionality, not just visual hierarchy

Light Mode Conversion:
	•	Much easier than you think - just use HSL
	•	Start with three base colors: white, gray, and black
	•	To convert: subtract the L (lightness) value from 100
	•	Example: Dark mode 60% lightness → Light mode 40% lightness
	•	Use CSS variables to switch between color schemes
	•	This works for gradients, backgrounds, text labels, and buttons

Practical Application:
	•	For PolyDebate: Use 14px or 16px as base size
	•	Emphasize market titles and model names with size + weight
	•	Deemphasize metadata (categories, timestamps) with reduced lightness
	•	Use line height for natural spacing between market cards
	•	Ensure selected tabs/buttons have higher contrast than unselected
	•	Group related information (title + thumbnail) with proximity
	•	Separate different sections with spacing and color lightness

7. Depth and Layering: Fixing Boring UIs

7.1 The Two-Step Process

Creating depth in UI design is a simple two-step process:
	•	Step 1: Create three to four shades of the same color
	•	Step 2: Create shadows

This transforms average designs into good designs with minimal effort.

7.2 Color Layering

The foundation of depth starts with color shades:
	•	Start with a base color
	•	Increase the lightness value by 0.1 (or 10%) for each layer
	•	Add lighter colors on top to create a sense of depth
	•	Use HSL color function - adjust the L (lightness) value
	•	Example: Base at 20% lightness, then 30%, 40%, 50% for layers

This creates visual hierarchy where lighter elements appear elevated and closer to the user, making them more important.

7.3 Shadow Techniques

Level 1 - Small Shadow (Most Common):
	•	Add a light border or glow on top
	•	Add a dark shadow at the bottom
	•	Combining soft and dark shadows gives a much more realistic feel than one basic shadow
	•	This is enough for most use cases

Level 2 - Medium Shadow:
	•	Bump the shadow values by a few pixels
	•	Adds more depth while staying subtle

Level 3 - Large Shadow:
	•	Push shadow values by a few more pixels
	•	Use sparingly for emphasis

Shadow Selection:
	•	Small shadows feel much more natural for most elements
	•	Choose shadow size based on element importance and context
	•	Larger shadows work well for hover states (especially on light mode)

7.4 Creating Realistic Depth

The key principle: Light hits elevated elements from above.
	•	Top part is lighter (light inset shadow or glow)
	•	Bottom part has dark shadow
	•	This simulates light coming from the top
	•	Elevated elements appear closer to the user, making them more important

This is a brilliant technique in UI design - using light and shadow to communicate hierarchy and importance.

7.5 Navigation Design with Depth

Average nav design can be improved:
	•	Add a few shades of the same color
	•	Layer them with lighter colors on top
	•	Add small shadows for depth
	•	Highlight selected tab with lighter shade
	•	Increase lightness on text and icon for selected state

7.6 Profile Cards

Standard profile cards can be enhanced:
	•	Add lighter color on important elements (layering)
	•	Add small shadow for depth
	•	Add bigger shadow on hover (works best on light mode)
	•	Never ignore light mode - it's the default theme for most people

7.7 Sidebar and Tab Design

Clean and simple sidebar design improvement:
	•	Add background color that's a bit lighter than the page itself
	•	Highlight selected tab by adding lighter shade
	•	Increase lightness on text and icon for selected tab (they may appear muted otherwise)
	•	Highlight dropdowns as main elements
	•	Add more depth by combining gradient with lighter inner shadow on top
	•	Shiny highlight up top complements linear gradients (simulates light from above)

7.8 Radio Buttons and Form Elements

Even simple UI elements benefit from depth:
	•	Wrap everything inside a lighter card
	•	Highlight the options and add spacing
	•	Emphasize the selected option
	•	Improve typography and rearrange for hierarchy
	•	Add depth to selected card with small shadow (light inset shadow up top, dark shadow at bottom)
	•	This sells the effect of light hitting the card because it's elevated

7.9 Dashboard and Data Visualization

For overall big picture UIs (sidebar, cards, graphs, tables):
	•	Choose a darker shade for the background
	•	Leave main elements as they are - they'll pop off the page
	•	Deemphasize less important elements with darker shades
	•	Create hierarchy: table darker than graph, graph darker than cards
	•	Remove borders on lighter elements (color creates separation)
	•	Add small shadow on smaller card, big shadow on bigger one
	•	Use shadows to raise or lower certain elements
	•	Add dark inset shadow on top and light inset shadow at bottom of tables (makes them appear deeper)
	•	Add slightly darker background color to sell the depth effect
	•	Design can change dramatically using just four shades of gray and some shadows
	•	Add color for next level (depends on context, but most colors work if done correctly)

7.10 Multi-Section UI Design

For UIs with multiple sections:
	•	Create three shades: dark (base), middle (bg), light (bg-light)
	•	Change page color to bg-dark as base for everything
	•	Separate sections by applying bg color
	•	Use round curves - they make anything beautiful
	•	Use bg-light for interactive elements (they make the interface)
	•	Add shadows to create depth
	•	Remove borders and use lighter shades to highlight instead
	•	Use dark and light inset shadows to push elements into cards (progress bars, etc.)
	•	Fix typography for important text
	•	Add icons to complement options (one-click SVG copy from online)
	•	Align elements consistently (buttons to the right, etc.)
	•	Remove unnecessary headings if section is self-explanatory

7.11 Light and Dark Theme Compatibility

Depth techniques work on both themes:
	•	All dark theme examples work on light theme
	•	All light theme examples work on dark theme
	•	Use color and shadow variables to assign background and box shadows
	•	Simply switch the variables - the techniques remain the same
	•	Always design for both themes - light mode is default for most people

7.12 The Design Secret

It takes a lot less effort to take an average design to good tier than it is to take a good design to S tier.

Analogy: Video game graphics settings
	•	Normal to High: Big graphics change
	•	High to Ultra: Huge FPS loss, but you don't really see the graphics quality difference
	•	High setting is the sweet spot for good graphics and playable FPS

Depth is that easy way to fix boring UIs - the sweet spot between effort and impact.

7.13 Application to PolyDebate

Market Cards:
	•	Use lighter shade for card background (elevated from page)
	•	Add small shadow for depth
	•	Lighter shade for hover state
	•	Selected market: lighter shade + shadow

Navigation:
	•	Layered colors for depth
	•	Selected tab: lighter shade with increased text/icon lightness
	•	Small shadows on nav items

Debate Results Dashboard:
	•	Main cards: medium shadows (they're important)
	•	Secondary info: darker shades, less shadow
	•	Model prediction cards: small shadows, lighter backgrounds
	•	Summary section: elevated with shadow

Buttons:
	•	Primary action buttons: lighter shade + shadow
	•	Hover: bigger shadow
	•	Secondary buttons: less shadow, darker shade

Tables and Data:
	•	Dark inset shadow on top, light inset shadow at bottom
	•	Darker background to create depth
	•	Lighter rows for hierarchy

Remember: Don't waste time perfecting every little detail when the outcome doesn't worth the effort. But adding depth is so satisfying and literally takes a few lines of code that makes it worth it.

11. Perplexity UI Color Scheme

Perplexity uses a thoughtfully curated color palette that balances vibrancy with accessibility across its interface. The design system combines bold accent colors for interactive elements with neutral tones for content areas, supporting both light and dark modes seamlessly.

11.1 Primary Accent Colors

The two most distinctive colors in Perplexity's palette are **Cyan Blue** (#00c2ff, RGB: 0, 194, 255) and **Coral/Answer Orange** (#ff6f59, RGB: 255, 111, 89). These colors represent the core interaction paradigm of the platform. The cyan is specifically used for query elements and active states, while the coral highlights answer elements and responses, creating visual distinction between user input and AI output.

11.2 Primary Interactive Color

Perplexity leverages **Primary Brand Blue** (#2563eb, RGB: 37, 99, 235) for links, buttons, and primary interactive elements throughout the interface. This deeper blue provides clear visual hierarchy and maintains strong contrast for accessibility purposes.

11.3 Supporting Accent Colors

**Sunny Yellow** (#f9c74f, RGB: 249, 199, 79) serves as a tertiary accent used for highlights and important notifications. Additionally, Perplexity incorporates **True Turquoise** or **Teal** (#21808D, RGB: 33, 128, 141), which functions as a core brand color and appears subtly throughout the interface to reinforce brand identity.

11.4 Neutral Colors

The neutral palette follows a clean, minimalist approach with **Paper White** as the dominant color for light mode backgrounds and content areas, while **Offblack** serves as the primary background color in dark mode. These neutrals enable the accent colors to stand out without overwhelming the interface.

11.5 Design Philosophy

The color scheme reflects Perplexity's broader branding philosophy centered on three main tones: **Offblack, Paper White, and True Turquoise.** These colors work together to evoke feelings of curiosity and innovation while maintaining a professional, trustworthy appearance. The palette demonstrates careful consideration for visual hierarchy, with bright accents guiding user attention to interactive elements while neutral backgrounds ensure content remains readable and focused.

The use of contrasting colors between queries (cyan) and answers (coral) creates intuitive visual feedback that aligns with the platform's core function as an answer engine, helping users quickly distinguish between their input and the AI's response across both light and dark theme variations.

11.6 Application to PolyDebate

For PolyDebate, we can adapt Perplexity's color philosophy:
- **Cyan Blue** (#00c2ff): Use for user queries, search inputs, and active states
- **Coral/Answer Orange** (#ff6f59): Use for AI responses, debate summaries, and answer highlights
- **Primary Brand Blue** (#2563eb): Use for primary buttons, links, and key interactive elements
- **Sunny Yellow** (#f9c74f): Use for important notifications, warnings, or highlights
- **True Turquoise** (#21808D): Use as a subtle brand accent throughout the interface
- **Paper White**: Light mode backgrounds
- **Offblack**: Dark mode backgrounds

This creates a clear visual distinction between user actions (cyan) and AI-generated content (coral), while maintaining professional fintech aesthetics.

12. Simplicity and User Experience: Don't Make Me Think

12.1 The Core Principle

Most people are lazy - not in a bad way, just in a "this isn't worth my brain power" kind of way. Attention spans are shorter than ever, so users should be able to figure things out instantly:
	•	What's the most important action here?
	•	What does this icon do?
	•	Where can I find more info?

When people land on a site, they bring expectations:
	•	They expect to see some links
	•	They expect buttons to look like buttons
	•	They expect text to be readable
	•	They expect icons to make sense

The moment you break that expectation, you force them to think - and that's the enemy.

12.2 The Google Example

Google is probably the purest example of "don't make me think":
	•	One search bar with options to search by text, voice, or image
	•	Two buttons: "Search" and "I'm Feeling Lucky"
	•	That's it - almost boring, but genius

Everyone knows exactly what to do - whether you're a kid searching for Superman costume, a teenager looking for how to impress girls, or a grandparent typing how to use Facebook. There's no need for instructions, no learning curve, and no unnecessary effort.

12.3 When Simplicity Fails

Example: Google Maps navigation issue:
	•	App says "continue straight" but road splits into flyover and flat road
	•	User is unsure which path to take
	•	Solution: App should recognize the split and provide clear instructions
	•	Instead of "continue straight", say "take the flyover" or "take the exit"
	•	Zoom in to show the split with bold line indicating correct path

Simplicity isn't about dumbing things down - it's about making things so obvious that users don't need to stop and think.

12.4 The Effortless Experience

Every click, every scroll, every field should feel effortless. If your user has to pause and ask:
	•	"Where's the menu?"
	•	"Is this a button or just text?"
	•	"What happens if I click this?"

Then your design has already lost.

12.5 Follow Established Patterns

Our brain loves patterns:
	•	Navigation at the top or on the side
	•	Buttons look like buttons (rectangles with text)
	•	Magnifying glass means search
	•	Cart icon means checkout

These patterns exist for a reason - they work. When you stick to conventions:
	•	Users feel comfortable
	•	They know what to expect
	•	They don't have to think

That's why when you install new software, all primary actions appear in the same place. Or when you notice all big and lengthy contracts ask you to sign at the same place across all pages.

You might worry that sticking to standard design will make your work boring, but trust me - it's not boring, it's good design. The goal isn't to reinvent the wheel, just make it roll better.

12.6 Constant Question: Is This Immediately Clear?

Confusion kills conversions. Whether you're designing:
	•	A hero section
	•	A signup form
	•	An entire app

Constantly ask yourself:
	•	Is this immediately clear?
	•	Would a first-time user understand what to do next?

If there's any doubt, simplify.

12.7 The Hard Truth About Simplicity

Simple designs are harder to make. A lot of people think that simple means easy or lazy - "Oh, you just added a gray background and a big button, that probably took 5 minutes."

The truth is: Simplicity takes work. It's much harder to create something clean and clear than it is to add a bunch of extra stuff.

Simplicity requires:
	•	Discipline
	•	Attention to detail
	•	A deep understanding of the user

It's not about what you add - it's about what you leave out. Figuring out what to remove while still delivering everything the user needs is incredibly challenging. It forces you to think, test, and iterate constantly.

Simple designs might look effortless, but behind the scenes they're the result of countless decisions made with precision and purpose. That's why simplicity isn't just a design choice - it's a skill, and it's one of the hardest to master.

12.8 Simple vs Minimal: Important Distinction

Simple doesn't mean minimal to the point of being useless. If a design is simple or minimal but lacks essential elements, it's bad design.

A lot of times you need to pack a lot of elements together so users can make an informed decision. But ask yourself:
	•	Do you really need three different buttons, or could a single clear button be more effective?
	•	Does that fancy animation add value, or is it just a distraction?

Every unnecessary thing you remove makes your design clearer and easier to use.

12.9 Make Text Scannable

Make your text easy to scan:
	•	Use headings and bullet points for key information
	•	Create visual hierarchies that guide the eye
	•	People aren't going to analyze the whole UI and click on the perfect option
	•	They will quickly scan the page and click the first reasonable or obvious option
	•	If the solution didn't work out, they will go back and try again

Your job is to make the perfect option the most obvious solution so they don't have to go back that often.

12.10 User Flow Design

Example: Building an online shoe store with many products and limited space to show them all. Users have to click multiple times to get to their preferred option.

For new users to complete their purchase, we need to make those clicks obvious and effortless. That's where a user flow diagram comes in - it guides the user on the shortest and simplest path to complete their objective.

User Journey Mapping:
	•	Create a fictional user to map out their journey
	•	Example: David, age 24, looking for black Oxford shoes for job interview
	•	He enters website and sees: three options, then four more, then five more, then maybe six or 60 more
	•	This is where most of the thinking will happen
	•	We want David to have an amazing user experience, so we add:
	  - Sorting options
	  - Filters
	  - Search bar (for users who don't like to go deep)

After some thinking and filtering, David got the shoe he wanted. The website didn't force him to log in - he can fill the shipping address and pay however he wants. This took some clicks, but we didn't make him think.

12.11 Design Implementation: Header and Navigation

Start with the main header:
	•	Logo on the top left
	•	Primary links
	•	Search bar
	•	Login button for returning customers

To reach the catalog, user clicks on "Men". According to user flow, we can show four main categories like a dropdown menu. But our job is to make the process of getting here much easier.

Get rid of additional layers of complexity and provide a simpler solution. This way users can get to the catalog in just two simple and obvious clicks.

12.12 Product Listing Page

This is where most of the thinking will happen, so we can't bombard the user with information. Show:
	•	Big and beautiful product image
	•	Clean and clear typography
	•	All the products, their ratings, the brand, and styles
	•	Most important detail: price

But we got a lot of options here - that means a lot of thinking. So help users by adding:
	•	Filters
	•	Sorting options

The page should be quite scannable now - easy to find a perfect option without a lot of thinking or going back and forth.

12.13 Product Detail Page: The Most Critical Page

This page has the most critical buttons. Users will have basic expectations:
	•	Images
	•	Reviews
	•	Color variations
	•	Size picker
	•	Delivery time
	•	Product details

Make all of this very easy to find and understand:
	•	Photos in carousel format to avoid unnecessary scrolling
	•	Most important information: product name and pricing (style it better to add hierarchy)
	•	Ratings with underline to tell it's clickable
	•	Color variations and size selector
	•	Automatically get user's zip code and show delivery notice
	•	Underline clickable text - these little details matter

Button Hierarchy:
	•	Delivery details and "Buy Now" belong together
	•	Product details aren't going to fit here anyway, so compromise and add the buttons instead
	•	But these buttons are competing for attention - add hierarchy by using color
	•	Then add product details without making the design too complicated or distracting from key actions

This won't be considered a minimal design - we're showing all essential elements to make an informed decision, but at the same time it's scannable and doesn't force you to think.

12.14 Convincing Stakeholders: Usability Testing

How to convince your boss or client on these decisions? Sometimes we get stuck with a bad designer, incompetent dev, or project manager who are too rigid to get on board.

Solution: Get them to watch a usability test.

What is a usability test?
	•	Get a target user to use your app for the first time
	•	Ask them to do something specific
	•	Then ask them to do the same thing on your competition

If they are performing better on other apps, why would they use yours? And if they won't use your app, you won't make money - your boss will understand that too, no matter how rigid they are.

Now bring out the prototype you have designed and test it with the same user. If the new design is performing better than the competition, it will get implemented. Everything follows money.
